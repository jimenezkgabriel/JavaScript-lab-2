1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
    .push() helps to insert new data in the array as opposed to creating a new array with the new data coming in.
2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
    Had to read the documentation to figure out how to actually use something like the .filter() method or the .includes() method. Include was easy as it checks if the array has the term, then returns a boolean. Filter was a bit more nuanced as you have to pass in a function then you can do whatever you want in that function to check if the term matches the with the item in the list, then returns a new array.
3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
    I would probably start using objects
